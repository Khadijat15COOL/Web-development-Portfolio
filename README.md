âš™ Setup Instructions

Create a project folder, html.file and  css.file, open a Terminal and navigate to the Project folder and use the live server extension in VS Code to open the project in a broswer. To host your project on GitHub, first initialize a Git repository by opening your project folder in the terminal and running git init. Next, add all your project files with git add . and commit your changes using git commit -m "Initial commit". Then, create a new repository on GitHub by clicking the "+" icon, selecting "New repository," and naming it (for example, legitportfolio). Make sure not to initialize the repository with a README or any other files. After that, connect your local repository to the newly created GitHub repository by running git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git, replacing YOUR-USERNAME and REPOSITORY-NAME with your actual GitHub username and repository name. Finally, push your code to GitHub using git push -u origin main (or replace main with master if that is your default branch). You can verify your files have been uploaded by visiting the repository page on GitHub. For future updates, simply repeat the process of adding, committing, and pushing your changes with git add ., git commit -m "your message", and git push.
